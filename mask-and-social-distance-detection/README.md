# mask-and-social-distance-detection
This is a computer vision project. It can detect wheater the person is wearing mask or not and detect the social distance between the persons. if they violate the soicial distance then a alert will br give.
* I have used two models for this project. one is for detecting the person and another is for detecting the mask and no mask
* Both models are SSD lite models. I have used default ssd lite model for person detection since its already trained for person class.
* For mask detection i have used around 1000 images for each class and trained 100k epochs.
